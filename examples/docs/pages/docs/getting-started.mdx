# Getting started

You can easily install Meow from npm:

```js
npm install meow-cms
```

You can then use it in your Next.js app by creating a new page:

```
my-nextjs-app/
├─ pages/
│  ├─ admin/
│  │  ├─ [[...meow]].jsx 

```

Create a folder inside your `pages` directory (`admin` in our case) and then add a catch-all route within it `[[...meow]].jsx`. 

Then you just need to import the main Meow component to render your new CMS:

```jsx
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'

const NextCMS = dynamic(() => import('meow-cms'), {
  ssr: false,
})

const CMS = () => (
  <NextCMS
    {...{
      // your settings will go here!
    }}
  />
)

export default CMS

```

Note: We use Next's dynamic import so Meow isn't added during the build!
