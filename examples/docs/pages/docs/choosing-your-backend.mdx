# Choosing your backend

In Meow terms a backend is the git provider you'll save your content to. Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket, etc. all have public APIs that all work slightly differently which requires completely new implementations on our side.

Each time you save a piece of content or upload media, Meow will use your provider's API to sync the changes to your git provider. Think of it as setting up a database and an API, but without the hassle.

Then you'll want to add both of these secrets to your `.env` file:

```
OAUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID={your github client id}
OAUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET={your github client secret}
```
