<Note>

At the moment Meow only supports Github as a backend, but other Git providers are planned for the future. Sorry! ðŸ˜º

# Choosing your backend

In Meow terms a backend is the git provider you'll save your content to. Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket, etc. all have public APIs that all work slightly differently which requires completely new implementations on our side.

Each time you save a piece of content or upload media, Meow will use your provider's API to sync the changes to your git provider. Think of it as setting up a database and an API, but without the hassle.

## Setting up Github as your backend

If you've been following along with the documentation, your Meow config should look something like this right now:

```tsx
const CMS = () => (
  <NextCMS
    {
      ...{
        // your settings will go here!
      }
    }
  />
)
```

Your configuration should follow this shape:

```tsx
const CMS = () => (
  <NextCMS
    {...{
      settings: {
        backend: {
          name: 'github',
          repo: '{your github username}/{your repo name}',
          branch: 'main', // the branch you want to edit, usually main or master
          base_url: 'https://mysite.com/', // the root address of your site
          auth_endpoint: 'api/auth', // where your auth endpoint is located
        },
      },
    }}
  />
)
```

### Getting your oAuth secrets

Meow leaves the authentication up to you, which means you need to set up an oAuth endpoint that will set a cookie to allow you to access your repo. First of all you'll need to create a new oAuth application and get your secret tokens. Go to [your Github settings](https://github.com/settings/profile) and follow along with the video.

Then you'll want to add both of these secrets to your `.env` file:

```
OAUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID={your github client id}
OAUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET={your github client secret}
```
