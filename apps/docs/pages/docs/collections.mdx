# Collections

A Meow collection is a grouping of similar content, you can use collections to split up content that is similar. For example:

- "Blogposts" is a collection that contains all of your blog's content
- "Authors" is a collection of the people who write said blogs
- "Categories" is a collections of the categories your blog posts fall under

<Note>

If you're familiar with databases you can think of each collection as its own table in a database, except instead of being a database they're markdown files contained in a folder 

</Note>

You can define a specific "schema" for each collection, which will define the shape of the data of each item in that collection. Your "schema" (Meow calls them fields!) will define which inputs appear when creating or editing content.

Each collection can also define any number of "blocks". Blocks are just React components that can be inserted in your markdown.
