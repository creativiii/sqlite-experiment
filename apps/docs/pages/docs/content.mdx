# Content view

When you first open Imput you'll get automatically redirected to the first `collection` you defined in your configuration. There's some extra options you can set to make your collections easier to browse.

## Preview cards

Imput attempts to generate preview cards from the `fields` configuration for your collection. For example:

1. The first `image` field found in your fields list will be used as a thumbnail
   1. If none are defined, no thumbnail is displayed
1. The first `string` field found in your fields list will be used as a post title
   1. If none are found Imput will fallback on using the post's filename

```js
collections: [
  {
    fields: [
      // this will be used as a title in the preview
      { label: 'Name', name: 'name', widget: 'string' },
      // this will be used as a thumbnail
      { label: 'Thumbnail', name: 'thumbnail', widget: 'image' },
      // this will be ignored
      { label: 'Subtitle', name: 'subtitle', widget: 'string' },
      { label: 'Content', name: 'body', widget: 'markdown' },
    ],
  },
]
```

To change what `field` is used you simply have to re-order your fields!

## Default order

Imput doesn't make any assumptions about what fields your content has, so there's options to set default sort depending on whichever `fields` you have defined.

```js
collections: [
  {
    // content in this collection will be ordered with the createdAt field
    // make sure the field here actually exists!
    orderBy: {
      value: 'createdAt',
      direction: 'desc',
    },
    fields: [
      { label: 'Name', name: 'name', widget: 'string' },
      { label: 'Created at', name: 'createdAt', widget: 'datetime' },
      { label: 'Content', name: 'body', widget: 'markdown' },
    ],
  },
```

<Note>

At the moment Imput supports sorting on `string`, `date` and `datetime` fields.
