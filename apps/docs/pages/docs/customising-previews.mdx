# Customising previews

One of the best features of Imput is the ability of viewing how the text in your page is going to look as you write it, including React components! Imput handles all of the MDX and compilation logic so you don't need to do it yourself.

Let's start from a basic configuration:

```tsx
const CMS = () => (
  <NextCMS
    {...{
      settings: {
        // more settings here !
        collections: [
          {
            name: 'docs',
            label: 'Docs',
            folder: 'apps/docs/pages/docs',
            create: true,
            slug: '{{name}}',
            extension: 'mdx',
            fields: [
              { label: 'Name', name: 'name', widget: 'string' },
              { label: 'Content', name: 'body', widget: 'markdown' },
            ],
            // the preview object is what we'll use to configure 
            // our CMS preview
            preview: {}
          },
        ],
      },
    }}
  />
)
```

# HTML Preview

The easiest way to start is to add an empty `preview.components` object:

```js
{
  preview: {
    components: {},
  },
}
```

This will tell Imput to convert your Markdown into HTML, even though it will be unstyled. To add styles you can use another `preview` configuration: `wrapper`. Wrapper renders an React component around your preview! You can use it to render a CSS-in-JS component that targets your preview or for a utility class like `tailwind-prose`.

```js
{
  preview: {
    components: {},
    wrapper: ({ children }) => <div className="prose">{children}</div>
  },
}
```

# React Preview

Imput is also able to render React components added with the "Block" feature in real-time.

```tsx
{
  preview: {
    // Any component defined here will be automatically rendered
    components: {
      // Imput will now render this component instead of the text "<Note>"
      Note: ({ children }: any) => {
        return (
          <div>
            <div>ðŸ’¡</div>
            <div>{children}</div>
          </div>
        )
      }
    },
  },
  // This will add the option to add a <Note> component
  // into the editor
  blocks: [
    {
      name: 'Note',
      label: 'Note',
      fields: [
        {
          name: 'children',
          label: 'Children',
          type: {
            widget: 'markdown',
          },
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
}
```
