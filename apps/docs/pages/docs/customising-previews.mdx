# Customising previews

One of the best features of Imput is the ability of viewing how the text in your page is going to look as you write it, including React components! Imput handles all of the MDX and compilation logic so you don't need to do it yourself.

Let's start from a basic configuration:

```tsx
const CMS = () => (
  <NextCMS
    {...{
      settings: {
        // more settings here !
        collections: [
          {
            name: 'docs',
            label: 'Docs',
            folder: 'apps/docs/pages/docs',
            create: true,
            slug: '{{name}}',
            extension: 'mdx',
            fields: [
              { label: 'Name', name: 'name', widget: 'string' },
              { label: 'Content', name: 'body', widget: 'markdown' },
            ],
            // the preview object is what we'll use to configure 
            // our CMS preview
            preview: {}
          },
        ],
      },
    }}
  />
)
```

## HTML Preview

The easiest way to start is to add an empty `preview.components` object:

```js
{
  preview: {
    components: {},
  },
}
```

This will tell Imput to convert your Markdown into HTML, even though it will be unstyled. To add styles you can use another `preview` configuration: `wrapper`. Wrapper renders an React component around your preview! You can use it to render a CSS-in-JS component that targets your preview or for a utility class like `tailwind-prose`.

```js
{
  preview: {
    components: {},
    wrapper: ({ children }) => <div className="prose">{children}</div>
  },
}
```

### Previewing Frontmatter

All your frontmatter data (i.e. things that aren't the main body of your content like title, date or author) are passed to the `header` and `footer` configurations. You can use these methods to make your preview look more like your actual page, or just display useful information to the editor.

```tsx
{
  preview: {
    components: {},
    // this will use your title contents and add it to an <h1> tag on top of your content
    header: ({ title }) => <h1 className="my-blog-heading">{title}</h1>,
    // this will use your author's name and render it below your content
    footer: ({ authorName }) => <p className="article-author">{authorName}</p>
  },
}
```

## React Components Preview

Imput is also able to render React components added with the "Block" feature in real-time. Adding a `components` object will replace any components in your MDX with the component matching its name.

```tsx
{
  preview: {
    // Any component defined here will be automatically rendered
    components: {
      // Imput will now render this component instead of the text "<Note>"
      Note: ({ children }: any) => {
        return (
          <div>
            <div>ðŸ’¡</div>
            <div>{children}</div>
          </div>
        )
      }
    },
  },
  // This will add the option to add a <Note> component
  // into the editor
  blocks: [
    {
      name: 'Note',
      label: 'Note',
      fields: [
        {
          name: 'children',
          label: 'Children',
          type: {
            widget: 'markdown',
          },
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
}
```

You can also use this configuration object to replace HTML tags! Define a component that matches an HTML tag:

```javascript
{
  preview: {
    components: {
      // Imput will now replace all H1 tags with the following HTML
      h1: (props: any) =>  (
          <h1 {...props} className="my-custom-class" />
        )
      }
    },
  },
```

## Adding styles to your previews

The last piece of the puzzle is adding styles to your previews. You can do so by using the `styles` array which accepts any number of public CSS files which will be fetched and loaded at runtime.

```typescript
{
  preview: {
    styles: ["/styles/global.css", "https://mysite.com/style.css"]
  }
}
```

<Note>

Styles need to be public to separate Imput's css from yours! If your styles are built at runtime you can usually add an extra rule to output a static version of them into a public-facing folder.
