# Collections

A collection in Meow is an assortment of content that all shares the same shape.

- All `posts` have both a title and an author
- All `authors` have an email and an email address
- And so on...

## Add a collection

Collections are added to cms' settings like everything else, you can define collections like this:

```javascript
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'
 
const NextCMS = dynamic(() => import('meow-cms'), {
  ssr: false,
})
 
const CMS = () => (
  <NextCMS
    {...{
      // your collections go in here!
      collections: []
    }}
  />
)
 
export default CMS
```
