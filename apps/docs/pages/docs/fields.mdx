# Fields

The `field` array in your collection configuration is used to define which inputs should appear when creating or modifying content in that specific collection. You can specify rules to validate or transform this input as well as which widget should be used to modify this input.

## Validation rules

Behind the scenes Meow uses the excellent [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/) for input validation. On each `field`  object you can define `rules`. The shape of your rules object accepts all kinds of validation options specified by the [react-hook-form register API](https://react-hook-form.com/api/useform/register/).

### Example: Require a field

In case you want to ensure content can't be created or saved without a specific input you can force it to be required. This would look something like this:

```js
{
  fields: [
    {
      label: 'Name',
      name: 'name',
      widget: 'string',
      rules: {
        required: 'This field is required',
      },
    }`
  ]
}
```

## Widgets

Widgets are what Meow calls different types of input you can use for fields.

<Note>

Meow doesn't yet support custom widgets, however they are on the roadmap. Hopefully the available widgets will cover most use-cases.
