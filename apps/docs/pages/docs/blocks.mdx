# Blocks

In Imput `blocks` are synonymous with MDX components, but we call them "blocks" to be more palatable for non-technical writers. Imput allows you to configure different blocks for each of your collections, meaning different parts of your site are able to use completely different kinds of components.

Your configuration is only aware of the composition of your MDX components, which leaves the freedom of how to display them on your site up to you.

## Tips and Tricks

In its current version Imput is mostly designed to be used with [`next-mdx-remote`](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote) on the front-end. Imput works great with setups that uses [`<MDXProvider/>`](https://mdxjs.com/docs/using-mdx/#mdx-provider) since it helps automatically replacing JSX components in your MDX without having to manually import them.

<Note>

That's not to say Imput won't support JSX imports in the future! While live-previewing these imports is most likely impossible, that doesn't mean Imput should stop you from writing them.

## Configuring blocks

Getting Imput to recognise your components is pretty straight forward:

```jsx
  <NextCMS
    {...{
      settings: {
        collections: [
          {
            // the rest of your collection configuration
            blocks: [
              // this is where your components config will go
            ],
          },
        ],
      },
    }}
  />
```

The next step is to match your component's composition: its name, its props, its types.

```jsx
  <NextCMS
    {...{
      settings: {
        collections: [
          {
            // the rest of your collection configuration
            blocks: [
              {
                name: 'Note',
                label: 'Note',
                fields: [
                  {
                    name: 'children',
                    label: 'Children',
                    type: {
                      widget: 'markdown',
                    },
                  },
                ],
              },
            ],
          },
        ],
      },
    }}
  />
```

The above configuration will allow Imput to output a component with this shape:

```jsx
<Note>
  Any **markdown** text here
</Note>
```
