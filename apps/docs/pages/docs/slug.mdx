# Slug

The `slug` option in your collection allows you to decide how your filenames are generated when creating new content. `slug` accepts a [handlebars string](https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/) as a configuration, you can use as many or as few values as you want.

```javascript
collections: [
  {
    // the rest of your config here
    slug: '{{uuid}}', // will result in "e3749707-85dd-4353-94a0-7ec3ff92e61e"
  }
]
```

Or:

```javascript
collections: [
  {
    // the rest of your config here
    slug: '{{year}}-{{month}}', // will result in "2024-03"
  }
]
```

## Changing filenames

At the moment Imput doesn't support changing filenames within the editor. However the feature is on the roadmap. You can track the feature here: [#112](https://github.com/leo-petrucci/imput-cms/issues/112).

## Using your own fields

The `slug` option accepts any `fields` you have configured for the current collection. These will be automatically slugified for you so no need to worry about doing that yourself.

```plain
collections: [
  {
    slug: '{{name}}', // if you type "my new article" in the field this will be "my-new-article"
    fields: [
      {
        label: 'Name',
        name: 'name',
        widget: 'string',
        rules: {
          required: 'This field is required',
        },
      },
    ],
  },
]
```
