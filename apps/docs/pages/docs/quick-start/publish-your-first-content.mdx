# Publish your first piece of content

If you've been following along with this getting started guide then it means you're ready to write your first content with Imput. You configuration should look something like this:

```tsx
const CMS = () => (
  <ImputCMS
    {...{
      settings: {
        backend: {
          name: 'github',
          repo: '{your github username}/{your repo name}',
          branch: 'main', 
          base_url: 'https://mysite.com/',
          auth_endpoint: 'api/auth', 
        },
        media_folder: 'public/images',
        public_folder: '/images',
        collections: [
          {
            name: 'page',
            label: 'Page',
            folder: 'content/pages',
            create: true,
            slug: '{{title}}',
            extension: 'mdx',
            fields: [
              { label: 'Title', name: 'title', widget: 'string' },
              { label: 'Content', name: 'body', widget: 'markdown' },
            ],
          },
        ],
      },
    }}
  />
)
```

Now visit the page where you're rendering Imput's main component and you'll be able to login ðŸŽ‰

<Note>

If your auth endpoints aren't publicly accessible yet, you can login locally by changing `base_url` to your local dev server:

```js
base_url: 'http://localhost:3000/',
```
