# Uploading media to Imput

Imput adopts a hands-off approach to media upload. We don't restrict what kind of files you want to upload as long as they fit the upload size allowed by your provider.

This is important because while Markdown might not support the specific filetype you uploaded Imput also understands that you might want to do something else with your files.

- You could have your own video component to playback videos
- You could simply want to link your users to a direct download
- Or maybe you just want to upload a file for safekeeping without manually going through your provider

Imput allows you to do all of these! Setting up your media is really straight forward:

```tsx
const CMS = () => (
  <ImputMS
    {...{
      settings: {
        media_folder: 'public/images',
        public_folder: '/images',
      }
    }}
  />
)
```

- `media_folder` is the folder in your project where your files will be uploaded
- `public_folder` is the public address where your files will be accessible from on your website

That's all ðŸŽ‰
