# Getting started

You can easily install Meow from npm:

```js
npm install meow-cms
```

You can then use it in your Next.js app by creating a new page:

```plain
my-nextjs-app/
├─ app/
│  ├─ admin/
│  │  ├─ [[...imput]]
│  │  │  ├─ page.jsx or page.tsx

```

Create a folder inside your `app` directory (`admin` in our case), then add a catch-all route within it `[[...imput]]` finally add a `page.tsx` or `page.jsx`.

<Note>

At the moment Imput only supports the `app` directory because of the way Next.js handles css imports.

</Note>

Then you just need to import the main Imput component to render your new CMS:

```jsx
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'

const ImputCMS = dynamic(() => import('imput-cms'), {
  ssr: false,
})

const CMS = () => (
  <ImputCMS
    {...{
      // your settings will go here!
    }}
  />
)

export default CMS

```

<Note>

Note: We use Next's dynamic import so Meow isn't added to the page's bundle. This also ensures Meow is only rendered client-side.
