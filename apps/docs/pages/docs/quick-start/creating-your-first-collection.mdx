# Collections

A collection in Meow is an assortment of content that all shares the same shape.

- All `posts` have both a title and an author
- All `authors` have an email and an email address
- And so on...

## Add a collection

Collections are added to cms' settings like everything else, you can define collections like this:

```tsx
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'

const NextCMS = dynamic(() => import('meow-cms'), {
  ssr: false,
})

const CMS = () => (
  <NextCMS
    {...{
      // your collections go in here!
      collections: [],
    }}
  />
)

export default CMS
```

Let's add the most bare-bones configuration for adding new pages. Your config will look something like this:

```tsx
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'

const NextCMS = dynamic(() => import('meow-cms'), {
  ssr: false,
})

const CMS = () => (
  <NextCMS
    {...{
      collections: [
        {
          name: 'page',
          label: 'Page',
          folder: 'content/pages',
          create: true,
          slug: '{{title}}',
          extension: 'mdx',
          fields: [
            { label: 'Title', name: 'title', widget: 'string' },
            { label: 'Content', name: 'body', widget: 'markdown' },
          ],
        },
      ],
    }}
  />
)

export default CMS
```

- `name` should be considered a unique id for your collection
- `label` should be a readable string that describes your collection (e.g. "Blog", "Pages", etc.)
- `folder` is where your files will be saved and updated in your repository
- `create` whether new content can be created for this collection
- `slug` is how Meow will generate your new content's filename (add link to slug page here)
- `extension` either "md" or "mdx", the file extension Meow will create your new content in
- `fields` this is your collection schema, in the example above our content will have a `title` and a `body` value

That's the bare minimum config! There's a lot more to collections but we'll go over it later. Next up, handling media uploads.
