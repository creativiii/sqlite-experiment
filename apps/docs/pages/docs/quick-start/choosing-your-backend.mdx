At the moment Imput only supports Github as a backend, but other Git providers are planned for the future. Sorry! ðŸ˜º

# Choosing your backend

In Imput terms a backend is the git provider you'll save your content to. Github, Gitlab, Bitbucket, etc. all have public APIs that all work slightly differently which requires completely new implementations on our side.

Each time you save a piece of content or upload media, Imput will use your provider's API to sync the changes to your git provider. Think of it as setting up a database and an API, but without the hassle.

## Setting up Github as your backend

If you've been following along with the documentation, your Imput config should look something like this right now:

```tsx
const CMS = () => (
  <ImputCMS
    {
      ...{
        // your settings will go here!
      }
    }
  />
)
```

Your configuration should follow this shape:

```tsx
const CMS = () => (
  <ImputCMS
    {...{
      settings: {
        backend: {
          name: 'github',
          repo: '{your github username}/{your repo name}',
          branch: 'main', // the branch you want to edit, usually main or master
          base_url: 'https://mysite.com/', // the root address of your site
          auth_endpoint: 'api/auth', // where your auth endpoint is located
        },
      },
    }}
  />
)
```

### Getting your oAuth secrets

Imput leaves the authentication up to you, which means you need to set up an oAuth endpoint that will set a cookie to allow you to access your repo. First of all you'll need to create a new oAuth application and get your secret tokens. Go to [your Github settings](https://github.com/settings/profile) and follow along with the video.

<Video src="/images/screen-recording-2023-03-11-at-135222.mov" />

Then you'll want to add both of these secrets to your `.env` file:

```plain
OAUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID={your github client id}
OAUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET={your github client secret}
```

### Create your endpoints

<Note>

The endpoints here are specific to Next.js, but the logic should be exactly the same for any other API framework. The only difference will be how you get certain headers.

If you're having trouble [open an issue on Github](https://github.com/creativiii/imput-cms/issues/new) and we'll add it to the docs.

</Note>

First create a config file for your oAuth, this file will tell our endpoints where to login on Github's side.:

```javascript
// lib/config.ts

export const config = (provider: "github") => ({
  client: {
    id: client[provider].id as string,
    secret: client[provider].secret as string,
  },
  auth: {
    tokenHost: auth[provider].tokenHost,
    tokenPath: auth[provider].tokenPath,
    authorizePath: auth[provider].authorizePath,
  },
});

const auth = {
  github: {
    tokenHost: "https://github.com",
    tokenPath: "/login/oauth/access_token",
    authorizePath: "/login/oauth/authorize",
  },
};

const client = {
  github: {
    id: process.env.OAUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID,
    secret: process.env.OAUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET,
  },
};
```

Then we'll create our endpoints. For this we'll use an external dependency:

```plain
npm install simple-oauth2
```

Then create the auth endpoint, this will generate your Github login link and send you to it:

```javascript
// pages/api/auth.ts

import { AuthorizationCode } from "simple-oauth2";
import { randomBytes } from "crypto";
import { config } from "../../lib/config";
import { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from "next";

export const randomString = () => randomBytes(4).toString("hex");

const auth = async (req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) => {
  const { host } = req.headers;
  const url = new URL(`https://${host}/${req.url}`);
  const urlParams = url.searchParams;
  const provider = urlParams.get("provider") as "github";

  const client = new AuthorizationCode(config(provider));

  console.log("host", host);
  console.log("provider", provider);

  // this will get us an auth url from github
  const authorizationUri = client.authorizeURL({
    redirect_uri: `https://${host}/api/callback?provider=${provider}`,
    scope: "repo,user",
    state: randomString(),
  });

  // and this will ensure the user logging in is redirected to it
  res.writeHead(301, { Location: authorizationUri });
  res.end();
};

export default auth;

```

Then you'll need to set up your callback endpoint, this one will receive the token from Github and send it back to Imput:

```javascript
// pages/api/callback.ts

import { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'
import { AuthorizationCode } from 'simple-oauth2'
import { config } from '../../lib/config'

const callback = async (req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) => {
  const { host } = req.headers
  const url = new URL(`https://${host}/${req.url}`)
  const urlParams = url.searchParams
  const code = urlParams.get('code') as string

  const provider = urlParams.get('provider') as 'github' | 'gitlab'
  const client = new AuthorizationCode(config(provider))
  const tokenParams = {
    code,
    redirect_uri: `https://${host}/api/callback?provider=${provider}`,
  }

  try {
    // we exchange our parameters for a token
    const accessToken = await client.getToken(tokenParams)
    const token = accessToken.token['access_token']

    res.statusCode = 200

    res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/html')
    // and then send a message back to the cms to login
    res.end(`
        <script type="text/javascript">
          if (window.opener) {
              window.opener.postMessage('${JSON.stringify({
                token,
                provider,
              })}', "*");
          }
          window.close();
        </script>
    `)
  } catch (e) {
    res.statusCode = 200
    res.end(renderBody('error', e))
  }
}

function renderBody(status: string, content: any) {
  return `
    <script>
        event.source.postMessage(
            'authorization:${content.provider}:${status}:${JSON.stringify(
              content
            )}',
            message.origin
        );
    </script>
  `
}

export default callback

```

Once these two endpoints are in place you should be able to visit your CMS page (the one you created in "[Getting Started](/docs/getting-started)" and use the Login button to login.

<Note>

If you want to login on localhost you're going to have to make sure you swap `https://` for `http://` where appropriate.
