# What is `imput-cms`?

`imput-cms`, referred to as Imput from here on out, is a Git-based Markdown and MDX content management system.

In practice, this means that you can use Imput to write and publish content without using a server! Imput will send any updates you want to make to your content directly to Github.

It also means that Imput can leverage the power of [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) to create complex and interactive pages using the power of React components.

## Why Imput?

There are **a lot** of Markdown editors that update Github out there. Most famously Netlify CMS (now renamed to [Decap CMS](https://decapcms.org/)). And while all of them are really _really_ good almost none of them support MDX.

Markdown is a fantastic tool for writing simple pages, but the reality is that a webpage can't just be rich text and images. It needs CTAs, it needs image carousels, it needs interactive forms; these are all things MDX can provide but that requires knowledge of React components which your average content writer won't have.

So Imput is two things:

1. An easy to use CMS system that allows editing markdown
1. An editor that is built so that content writers can use React components without understanding the intricacies of React

## What can I build with Imput?

Imput is just a way to write and manage content, so as long as you're looking to publish content on the web, Imput can probably help you!

1. This documentation site is written entirely in Imput
1. [Ironeko](https://ironeko.com/) is a blog built with Imput

You can head over to our examples and learn from those if you prefer to learn that way.
