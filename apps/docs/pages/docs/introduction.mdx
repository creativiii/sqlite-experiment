# What is `meow-cms`?

`meow-cms`, referred to as Meow from here on out, is a Git-based Markdown and MDX content management system.

In practice, this means that you can use Meow to write and publish content without using a server! Meow will send any updates you want to make to your content directly to Github.

It also means that Meow can leverage the power of [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) to create complex and interactive pages using the power of React components. 

## What can I build with Meow?

Meow is just a way to write and manage content, so as long as you're looking to publish content on the web, Meow can probably help you!

1. This documentation site is written entirely in Meow
1. [Ironeko](https://ironeko.com/) is a blog built with Meow

You can head over to our examples and learn from those if you prefer to learn that way.
