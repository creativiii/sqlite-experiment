# What is `imput-cms`?

`meow-cms`, referred to as Imput from here on out, is a Git-based Markdown and MDX content management system.

In practice, this means that you can use Imput to write and publish content without using a server! Imput will send any updates you want to make to your content directly to Github.

It also means that Imput can leverage the power of [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) to create complex and interactive pages using the power of React components. 

## What can I build with Imput?

Imput is just a way to write and manage content, so as long as you're looking to publish content on the web, Imput can probably help you!

1. This documentation site is written entirely in Imput
1. [Ironeko](https://ironeko.com/) is a blog built with Imput

You can head over to our examples and learn from those if you prefer to learn that way.
