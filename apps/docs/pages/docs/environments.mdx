# Environments

Imput is framework-agnostic, this means that it can be used with any combination of React and backend.

That said, it is _kind-of_ built with Next.js in mind and it will be a lot easier to set up if you're using Next.js + Vercel. That's because Imput needs two things to work:

1. A React application to render the admin frontend
1. Two endpoints for logging in

Vercel and Next.js happen to offer both as part of the same package.

If you need help getting Imput to work with your stack feel free to open an issue on Github.
